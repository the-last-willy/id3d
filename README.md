This project contains some of my - Willy Jacquet - [master's degree](http://master-info.univ-lyon1.fr/ID3D/) class projects.

These projects were made using [AbstractGL](https://github.com/the-last-willy/abstractgl), a collection of libraries I made for graphics programming.

The underlying graphics API is OpenGL 4.5.

In this repository you can find all the source code as well as the reports that I submitted.
The reports are written in French though.

Below are images taken from the submitted reports.

# [3D Image Synthesis](3d_image_synthesis.pdf)

The goal of this project was to explore rendering.
I chose to focus on optimization and culling technics (frustum, occlusion and light).

Both the frustum and occlusion culling were implemented on compute shaders.

The whole scene is rendered within a single draw call in forward rendering.

A few final renders:

# [Implicit modelling](implicit_modelling.pdf) ([Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/sd3XWX))

In this project we had to make any object in shadertoy using implicit geometric representations.
I ended up making a shadertoy like viewer with editing features, it took me a lot of work and wasn't required.

The editor generates GLSL code based on a hierarchical symbolic based representation of the object.
It provides a free movement camera as well as the capacity to interact with parameters of subobjects and their transformations.

At the end I just pasted the code generated into a shadertoy.

The coolest master Roshi ever made in shadertoy:

At first I wanted to make an orerry but it was rejected by the teacher for some reason.

# [Meshes and computational geometry](meshes_and_computational_geometry.pdf)

In this project we had to implement mesh representations and mesh maniputation algorithms.

Unfortunately, there's is not much to show as I spent a lot of time optimizing data structures and ensuring the algorithms were correct.

A lot of work was done on mesh element traversal and I came up with, I believe, some interesting ideas.

The mesh representation is able to support abitrary data on elements as well as arbitrary topology.

The project had a part on 2D triangulations and one on 3D triangulation.
