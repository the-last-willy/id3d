# Willy Jacquet 11806811

This project is an attempt to merge a few of my master's degree (ID3D) class projects into a single one.

# Motivation

I spent a great amount of time developping a [collection of libraries for graphics programming](https://github.com/the-last-willy/abstractgl) from scratch.

Therefore I believe this to be a win-win situation; I get to continue enhancing my library with tools encountered in classes and I avoid doing things I have already done. This will require more work out of me - as I need to maintain and adapt a larger codebase - but I expect the end results to be greatly enhanced.

# Projects

Some of these projects have been made in group.
The link below will redirect you 

- [3D Image Synthesis](src/iehl) with Yoan Parra 11505740
- [Meshes and Computational Geometry](src/chaine) with Yoan Parra 11505740

# Compatibility

Support for OpenGL 4.5 is required.

??? CMake
??? MSVC
??? GCC

# Compilation

This project uses git submodules, to clone them as well, you can use the following command:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/the-last-willy/sandbox.git
```

If you do not wish to download the full history, you can add the option `--depth=1` to the previous command.

# Usage
