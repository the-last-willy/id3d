# Geometric Modelling: Implicit Modeling

# Assignement

We were tasked on making

I chose to do the Kame House.

# Utilitary tools

A bunch of tools were developped during this project.

## Shadertoy-like viewer

Shadertoy is a very good tool but I find it to be lacking beside that it's loading slowly most of the time.

Many quality of life improvements can be made while still preserving :
- A free camera
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Multiple views and configurations

I mean, sure there are *stateful* **hacks** (let's call it what it is) using buffers and textures.
But you still have to go out of your way to implement it and it is not without cost - at the very least performance.

## Automatic GLSL generation

TODO

# Results

You will have to wait a little bit for that one as it is ongoing work boyo.
