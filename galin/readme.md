# Geometric Modelling: Implicit Modeling

# Assignment #1

We were tasked on modeling any object of our choice using signed distance fields (SDF) (or blobs).

## Utilitary tools

I had many idea for utility tools.
All of them are way outside the scope of this project and will eventually be made into their own projects.

### Shadertoy-like viewer

Shadertoy is an amazing tool but it lacks interactive editing features (as that would be way beside what they do).

Therefore I tried to implement many quality of life features on a Shadertoy compatible viewer:
- A free camera
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Interactive transformations and parameters
- GLSL include

I mean, sure there are *stateful* **hacks** (let's call it what it is) using buffers and textures.
But you still have to go out of your way to implement them and it is not without cost - some performance at the very least.

### Automatic GLSL generation

TODO

## Results

At first I tried to make an orrery (Shadertoy) but it turned out to be focused on animation and rendering,
which was not the assignement.
So I dropped it eventually.

They I went on to make the Kame House.
I wanted to add Master Roshi to the scene but I ended up making him much more detailled than anticipated and I didn't have time to finish the Kame House. So the end result is just Master Roshi ([Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/sd3XWX)).
